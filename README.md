# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple Ruby implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts each letter in a text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

## How It Works

- The script prompts the user to enter a text and a number.
- It then shifts each letter in the text by the given number (wrapping around the alphabet if necessary).
- Non-letter characters remain unchanged.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mirkodev93/Caesar_Cipher.git
    cd Caesar_Cipher
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    ruby 1_Caesar_Cipher.rb
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to enter your text and the shift number.

## Example

```
Enter a text:
Hello, World!
Enter a number:
3
Ebiil, Tloia!
```
